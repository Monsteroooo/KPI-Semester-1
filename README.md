C Programming Foundations: Engineering & Math

This repository contains a collection of low-level software engineering projects developed during my first year at Igor Sikorsky KPI (Department of Informatics and Software Engineering).
Key Projects
1. Numerical Methods Solver

    Goal: Solves complex transcendental equations using iterative methods (Newton's & Bisection).
    Tech: Pure C implementation of Taylor Series for trigonometric functions (my_sin, my_cos) to ensure precision without standard libraries.
    Math: Handles angle normalization and function pointers for modularity.

2. SLAE Linear Solver (Jacobi Method)

    Goal: Solves Systems of Linear Algebraic Equations using the Jacobi iterative method.
    Features: Automated verification for diagonal dominance to ensure convergence before calculation.
    Optimization: Efficient memory management for dynamic 2D arrays.

3. Binary Data Management System

    Goal: Robust tool for processing regional data records.
    Tech: Direct Binary File I/O (read/write/seek).
    Algorithm: Implemented on-disk Bubble Sort capable of sorting records by multiple criteria (Name, Area, Population).

Technical Stack

    Language: C11 (ISO/IEC 9899:2011)
    Environment: Linux Mint & GCC
